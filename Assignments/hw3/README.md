Q1
I followed the exampled and made the FST1 no problem. I did a bunch of modified inputs to ensure they worked correctly
Q2 
I explored in bash first what the correct command would be and after I figured it out I coded out something quick in python because I prefer the way python reads files
Q3
I expanded my previous fst_acceptor to deal with probabilities and the properties of FSTs. To deal with ambiguous FSTs i follwed the instruction and if it isnt a NFA then it must be ambigous
Q4
This one took a really long time but when I implemented what was shown in the slides and then used the slide walk through to debug I was able to get the results I was looking for. I believe everything works fine!
